# Encoder-Decoder
This code is a simple GUI application for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar cipher.

Here are some comments explaining different parts of the code:

The caesar_cipher function applies the Caesar cipher to the given text.
It takes the text, shift value, and encode/decode flag as inputs and returns the resulting text after applying the cipher. The function iterates over each letter in the text and checks if it is in the defined alphabet. If it is, it calculates the new index of the letter based on the shift value and appends the corresponding letter from the alphabet to the result. If the letter is not in the alphabet, it is appended as is.

The validate_input function is called when the user clicks the "Submit" button.
It validates the user input and performs the encoding or decoding operation based on the selected direction (encode or decode). It retrieves the text and password from the input fields, calculates the shift value using the calculate_shift function, and calls the caesar_cipher function to get the result. The result is then displayed in the GUI.

The calculate_shift function calculates the shift value based on the given password.
It sums the ASCII values of all characters in the password to obtain the shift value.

The copy_to_clipboard function is called when the user clicks the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
It copies the text displayed in the result field to the system clipboard using the pyperclip library.

The code sets up the GUI using the PyQt6 library.
It creates a window and adds various widgets such as labels, input fields, buttons, and layouts to arrange them.
The QGridLayout is used to organize the widgets in a grid-like structure.

The direction_groupbox is a group box that contains radio buttons for selecting the direction of encoding or decoding.

The code sets the styles for the window and buttons using CSS-like syntax.
It defines the background color, text color, font size, and other properties.

Finally, the window is shown and the application enters the event loop using app.exec().

Overall, the code provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages using the
Caesar cipher and allows copying the result to the clipboard for easy sharing.
